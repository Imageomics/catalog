# Catalog Generation with Gemini 2.5

This project was initialized with the help of Gemini 2.5, accessed [through OSU](https://ai.osu.edu/faculty-staff-students/approved-ai-tools). In addition to speeding up the development of this site, I was curious about how much Gemini could do and where it would falter. As such, I've included the full prompt/discussion below. Please note, my only corrections to any of its responses are those I directed back to the model to fix the provided code, so treat this as you would any model-generated response. I include a few notes (as Note Admonitions) throughout for clarity and context.

## Chat Transcript

> [!NOTE]
> I asked Gemini to provide a transcription of the chat. For some reason it started at [Chat Transcription](#chat-transcription), below, instead of including the initial prompt and follow-up request that I added here.

**Actual initial prompt:**

Please generate a keyword-searchable data catalog website with HTML/CSS.  This site should be able to read all the public dataset README.md files from a Hugging Face organization and provide a feature to search based on the tags in the README.md yaml section and overall README.md content. It would be great if it could also highlight new datasets and provide filters to search based on date of creation, date of last update, and alphabetically (both A to Z and Z to A). Please also make sure to design and document the code as for a larger project with multiple contributors so that it is clear what each portion does.

**Response:**

I can certainly create that for you. This project requires fetching data from the Hugging Face API and building a dynamic website, so it will be a single HTML file with all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I will also create a separate documentation file (`README.md`) to outline the project's structure, which is essential for a project with multiple contributors. This will help you understand the code and get started with a local development environment.

Here are the two files: one for the website and one for the documentation.

**Follow-up request:**

This is a great start\! Can you specifically look only at the Imageomics Organization's datasets (https://huggingface.co/imageomics) and also add in an option to search models and spaces?

**Response:**

Here is the updated Hugging Face Hub Catalog, now focused on the "imageomics" organization and including the ability to search models and spaces. I've also updated the documentation to reflect these new features, which is crucial for a collaborative project.

You'll find two files below: the `index.html` for the web application and the updated `README.md` for project documentation.

### Chat Transcription

Below is a complete transcription of our conversation, including all code blocks and formatting.

---

**User:** A dataset card (the README.md file in the dataset repository) usually starts with "Dataset card for" and then the name (or "pretty\_name" in yaml) of the dataset. A short description is often provided following that. Model cards are set up analogously. Can you display the pretty\_name as the heading and use only that short description following the "Dataset card for" or "Model card for" line as a description of the datasets and models?

**Response:** This is a great request. I've updated the index.html file to display the more user-friendly "pretty name" as the main heading and to use the short description from the dataset or model card's YAML metadata.

I've also changed the code to be more robust by prioritizing the clean, structured data from the API's cardData object, which is exactly where the pretty\_name and short descriptions are stored.

You can see the changes in the updated index.html file below.

---

**User:** The model links are not working, they should be "[https://huggingface.co/imageomics/](https://huggingface.co/imageomics/)\<model-name\>", but instead are "[https://huggingface.co/models/imageomics/](https://huggingface.co/models/imageomics/)\<model-name\>". Can you fix that?

**Response:** I've updated the index.html file to fix the model links. The links were incorrectly including models/ in the path, but the correct URL for a model under an organization should go directly to the organization's page.

The corrected code now checks the repository type and constructs the correct URL path for datasets, models, and spaces.

---

User: Can you update the color scheme to use Imageomics' official colors, provided below?  
Primary Colors:

* Imageomics Green: \#92991c  
* Imageomics Blue: \#5d8095  
* Dark Teal: \#0097b2  
  Accent Colors:  
* Light Green: \#9bcb5e

**Response:** I've updated the color scheme of the Hugging Face Catalog to use the official Imageomics brand colors.

The new palette has been applied to key elements:

* The main heading is now **Imageomics Green** (\#92991c).  
* Accent elements like the focus rings on the search and filter inputs are now **Dark Teal** (\#0097b2).  
* The tags and "New\!" badges use the **Light Green** accent color (\#9bcb5e).  
* Links to the Hugging Face Hub are now colored with **Imageomics Blue** (\#5d8095).

Here is the updated index.html file with the new color scheme.

---

**User:** Can you add comments to the style section indicating what colors change?

**Response:** I can certainly add comments to the style section of the Canvas to clarify the colors used.

Here is the updated index.html file with comments added to the style block.

---

**User:** Can you add scroll options to see more info in the preview boxes? Specifically, can you make the description parts longer and limit the tags to two lines but scrollable?

**Response:** I've updated the index.html file to give you more control over the information you see in each preview card.

Here are the specific changes:

* **Expanded Description:** The description box is now taller, allowing you to see more of the summary for each dataset, model, or space.  
* **Scrollable Tags:** The tag section is now limited to two lines. If a repository has more tags than will fit, you can scroll vertically to see them all.

This should make it much easier to quickly scan the cards while still having access to all the relevant information.

---

**User:** That's so much better, thanks\! In the style section, can you add comments indicating which element's formatting or color is controlled by that code snippet?

**Response:** That's a great suggestion. Adding more specific comments will make it much easier to understand how each part of the style sheet controls the look of the website.

I've updated the index.html file to include detailed comments in the \<style\> block. You'll now find explanations for what each CSS rule does, from the overall body font to the specific hover effects and the new tag and description scroll features.

---

**User:** Can you modularize the code for improved development? For instance, setting up a CSS style file and pulling out any functional aspects that may not need to live in the index.html file. Also, this should be runnable as a GitHub Page.

**Response:** I've modularized the Canvas for better maintainability and improved the file structure for easier development.

I've separated the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into three distinct files. This structure is ideal for hosting on a platform like GitHub Pages, as it keeps your project organized and scalable.

---

**User:** Do I also need another file to run the site?

**Response:** That's a great question. You will need all three files that were generated: index.html, style.css, and main.js.

These three files work together to create the website:

* index.html provides the main structure of the page.  
* style.css controls the visual appearance and layout.  
* main.js handles the functionality, such as fetching data and filtering the items.

With these three files in the same directory, you should be able to run the site.

---

**User:** I only see a sytle.css and main.js, can you provide the updated index.html?

**Response:** Here is the updated index.html file. It's the main file for the website's structure and links to the other files we've created.

---

**User:** Thank you\!

**Response:** I've updated the style.css Canvas to include more specific comments. I've broken down each CSS rule to explain exactly which element's formatting or color it controls.

Here is the updated style.css file with the more detailed comments.

**User:** Can you update the project documentation to match the current state?

**Response:** Here is the updated project documentation that reflects the current, modularized state of the code.

This README.md file now details the file structure and explains how to run the application, which is helpful for platforms like GitHub Pages.

This updated documentation should make it much clearer how the different files work together. Let me know if you would like to add or change any other details in the documentation.

**User:** When I open index.html in my browser (with all files in the same folder), it's not loading any datasets (see screenshot).

**Response:** Thanks for providing the screenshot. I see the issue. When you open the index.html file directly from your local computer, modern browsers often block the JavaScript from making the API call to Hugging Face due to security restrictions (specifically, the "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing" or CORS policy).

The most straightforward way to fix this is to run a local web server to serve the files. A simple way to do this is with Python, if you have it installed.

**Running a Simple Local Server**

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.  
2. Navigate to the directory where your three files (index.html, style.css, and main.js) are located.  
3. Run the following command:  
   Bash  
   python3 \-m http.server

   If that doesn't work, try \`python \-m http.server\` instead.

4. Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

This will serve the files from a local server, bypassing the security restriction and allowing the JavaScript to fetch the data correctly.

---

**User:** Our original one-page version works though?

**Response:** That's an excellent observation and it gets to a key difference in how web browsers handle local files versus files served from a web server.

The one-page version worked because all the code—the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—was contained within a single file. When you opened it, the browser loaded everything at once, and the script didn't have to make a separate request to load a different file.

In the modularized version, the index.html file needs to fetch the main.js and style.css files as external resources. When you open the index.html file directly from your computer (using the file:// protocol), a browser's security features, specifically the **Same-Origin Policy**, can prevent it from loading these external files and making the necessary API calls. This is a security measure to protect your computer.

By using a local web server, you're essentially telling the browser to treat the files as if they were being served from a normal website, which bypasses those local security restrictions and allows the application to run as intended.

> [!NOTE]
> The next request is where it broke \-- used the catalog as it was at this point.

**User:** Can you add a differentiation between "tags", "tasks", and other identifiers? Specifically, I like the dropdown for tags, but would also like one for "tasks" and "modalities". Then organize other identifiers in an "other identifiers" option, sorted alphabetically

**Response:** I can definitely do that. I've updated the index.html file to add new dropdown menus for tasks and modalities, and a separate section to display any other identifiers. The main.js file now handles the population and filtering of these new options.

Here are the updated files:

* index.html: Contains the new filter dropdowns and a dedicated section for "Other Identifiers" in the card structure.  
* main.js: Includes the logic to fetch, parse, and filter by these new identifiers.  
* style.css: Updated to make sure the new elements are displayed correctly.

---

### **File Updates**

Here are the updated versions of the files to implement the new filtering and display options you requested.

---

**User:** Can you make these other options responsive to the type of repository selected? So that all of them have tags, but Datasets also have tasks and modalities, while Models have libraries (library\_name from the yaml) and datasets, and Spaces have SDK, models, and datasets?

**Response:** This is an excellent idea that will make the catalog much more useful. I have updated both the index.html and main.js files to add dynamic filters based on the selected repository type.

Here are the specific changes I've made:

* **HTML Structure:** The index.html file now contains separate filter sections for Datasets, Models, and Spaces. Each section is initially hidden, and the main.js file will show the correct one when you select a repository type.  
* **Dynamic Filtering:** The main.js file has been completely updated to handle this new logic. When you change the "Repository Type" dropdown, the script now:  
  1. Hides all the filter sections.  
  2. Fetches data for the selected repository type.  
  3. Populates and shows only the filters relevant to that repository (e.g., tasks and modalities for datasets, libraries and datasets for models, and sdk, models, and datasets for spaces).  
* **Improved Card Display:** The repository cards themselves now correctly display the relevant identifiers (Tasks, Modalities, Libraries, etc.) instead of grouping them all under "Other Identifiers."

I've also added extra comments to the JavaScript to explain the new, more complex logic.

---

**User:** Can you provide the updated files?

**Response:** I understand. It looks like you're looking for the complete set of files to go with the updated index.html. Here are all three files, including the updated main.js with the new filtering logic and the style.css file to ensure everything looks correct.

You can save these files and run them from a local server to see the new dynamic filters in action.

> [!NOTE]
> It never seemed to actually re-provide the files, instead requiring that I go back to pull the original, which would be updated. These updates also removed some of the extra comments it had added earlier on, and quite systematically for the CSS file, reducing the utility of the comments.

---

**User:** I don't see the files here. Further up in the chat they do seem to be edited, though. Can you add documentation back into the files so it's clearer to collaborators which portions of the code do what?

**Response:** Absolutely\! I apologize for the confusion. Here are all three files with extensive documentation added to help collaborators understand the code's purpose and functionality more easily.

I've added comments throughout the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to explain each section, variable, and function.

---

**User:** There should be the lower bar with tags, tasks, etc as described previously based on the type of repository, but the tags are still lumped into one "All tags" dropdown. Things like "tasks" and "size\_categories" should be separate dropdown options.

**Response:** It looks like you've correctly identified an issue with the filter dropdowns. I see what you mean; the current setup is combining all the filter options into a single "All Tags" dropdown, which isn't the intended behavior.

The good news is that the structure you need is already present in the index.html file. The problem lies in the main.js file, which is not correctly populating the separate filter dropdowns for tasks, size\_categories, and others.

I've updated the main.js file to fix this. Now, when you select a repository type (like Datasets), the relevant and separate filter dropdowns will appear with their own unique options.

---

**User:** Can you add the imageomics logo (attached) to the header of the site?

**Response:** I have reviewed the code and can add the Imageomics logo to the header. I will add the image and update the styling to ensure it is correctly positioned.

---

**User:** How do I change the pulsing new background color?

**Response:** The pulsing background color of the "NEW\!" badge is controlled by the .new-badge class in your style.css file.

To change it, you just need to update the **background-color** property within that code block.

Here is the exact snippet you'll find in style.css:

CSS

/\* Animation for the "New\!" badge. \*/  
.new-badge {  
    background-color: \#9bcb5e; /\* Light Green \*/  
    color: \#92991c; /\* Imageomics Green \*/  
    animation: pulse 1.5s infinite;  
}

Simply replace the \`\#9bcb5e\` color code with your desired color. For example, to use the Imageomics Blue, you would change the line to:

\`background-color: \#5d8095;\`

Let me know if you'd like to change any other colors or styling\!

\---

\*\*User:\*\* That doesn't seem to have worked

\*\*Response:\*\* You are absolutely right. My apologies for that oversight. The issue is that the JavaScript file was not correctly populating the separate dropdowns for tasks, modalities, and other identifiers. It was still using older logic that grouped everything into one "All Tags" dropdown.

I've corrected the \`main.js\` file to properly handle the dynamic filtering based on the repository type you select. This includes correctly populating the separate dropdowns for "Tasks" and "Modalities" when on the Datasets tab, "Libraries" for Models, and so on.

Here are the updated files:

\---

> [!NOTE]
> I changed the color in [this commit](https://github.com/Imageomics/catalog/commit/a59a810256d7eeef4635ad5b3aa0e93fd9734cac#diff-58417e0f781b6656949d37258c8b9052ed266e2eb7a5163cad7b0863e6b2916aL126-R129). The issue was actually that it was defining the color at this line, overriding the CSS stylesheet.

Following these attempts, I uploaded the three files to Gemini 2.5 Pro instead and asked it for help fixing the tag issue that Flash could not. The results from that are included from [commit c71e72c](https://github.com/Imageomics/catalog/commit/c71e72cf9000dad5603ea5d9fe1d09bd79717d3e). The initial prompt is provided below; as can be seen from the diff, it rewrote mos tof the codebase. It is generally better to be more precise in what is desired and ask it to plan first (see [example](https://github.com/Imageomics/catalog/issues/1#issue-3407099426)).
